Banking Kata - Scala Developers Barcelona
=========================================

This kata will take place on Nov. 23, 2017. It is an adapted version of the banking kata from http://kata-log.rocks/

To start, download/clone the repository and import the project with IntelliJ. You can also use plain old `vim`  and  `sbt`. Enjoy!

Copy of the (almost) original explanation:

### Your Task

Your bank is tired of its mainframe COBOL accounting software and they hired both of you for a greenfield project in - what a happy coincidence

    your favorite programming language!

Your task is to show them that your TDD-fu and your new-age programming language can cope with good ole’ COBOL!


### Requirements

Write a class Account that offers the following methods void deposit(double) double withdraw(double) void printStatements() and double balance

An example statement would be:
